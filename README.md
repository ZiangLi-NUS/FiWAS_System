Prerequest: MATLAB 2023a or above with signal processing toolbox, wavelet toolbox
raw data should be in ".mat" format, as a variable named "voltage_array"
such .mat file should contain sampling rate information in the file name,
e.g. "heart raw data_5k.mat" (for sampling rate 5kHz)

download the code with the demo data, the code can be directly run
The code has been tested on MATLAB 2023b on mac OS 15, MATLAB2024a on mac OS 26 and MATLAB 2025a on Win11
Plots of raw data and filtered data with FFT analysis are expected as the outcome of the code.
